# Clinical_Trial_Simulation
This idea behind this project is to simulate what might happen if a drug is taken through all phases of development. It is designed to help pharmaceutical teams make data-driven go/no-go decisions for clinical trials. I will accomplish this via Monte Carlo simulations and statistical analyses to model potential outcomes.
